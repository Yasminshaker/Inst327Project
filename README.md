This project is a team effort focused on designing a database for beauty products using a dataset from Kaggle. 
We used MySQL for database creation and developed stored programs to manage and interact with the data effectively.

Files Included: 
- Beauty_products_data.xlsx: Contains the dataset used for the project.
Source: [Kaggle - Most Used Beauty Cosmetics Products in the World](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/waqi786/most-used-beauty-cosmetics-products-in-the-world) 
- Beauty_products_ERD.mwb: MySQL Workbench file used to design the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the database.
- Beauty_products_database.sql: SQL script used to create the database schema, including all tables and relationships.
- Beauty_products_programs.sql: SQL script containing stored programs such as procedures, functions, and triggers used in the project.
